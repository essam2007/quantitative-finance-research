# Quantitative Finance Research

This repository contains research driven projects in quantitative finance with emphasis on rigorous mathematical foundations and continuous time modeling.

The focus is on stochastic calculus stochastic differential equations martingale pricing theory and continuous time asset pricing frameworks. Implementations aim to connect financial mathematics theory with computational modeling.

## Research Themes

Stochastic calculus and Ito lemma  
Simulation of Brownian motion and diffusion processes  
Martingale pricing theory and risk neutral valuation  
Continuous time asset pricing models  
Volatility modeling including the Heston model  
Statistical arbitrage and systematic alpha construction  
Factor replication and cross sectional asset pricing  

## Mathematical Framework

This repository emphasizes deep mathematical structure including

Measure theoretic probability  
Stochastic differential equations  
Change of measure techniques  
Martingale representation results  
Continuous time portfolio theory  
Partial differential equation methods in finance  

All models are developed from first principles starting from probability space construction and progressing toward implementable numerical schemes.

## Implementation Philosophy

Each project follows three stages

Mathematical derivation  
Model construction  
Computational implementation  

The objective is to maintain theoretical rigor while ensuring practical reproducibility.

## Technical Stack

Python  
NumPy  
SciPy  
Matplotlib  
Jupyter Notebook  

Additional implementations may include C plus plus for performance intensive simulations.

## Current Development

Brownian motion simulation  
Geometric Brownian motion modeling  
Black Scholes derivation from SDE formulation  
Heston stochastic volatility simulation  
Factor based alpha research  

## Long Term Objective

To build a mathematically rigorous research portfolio in quantitative finance suitable for advanced study in financial engineering or doctoral level research and for professional quantitative research roles.
